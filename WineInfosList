Name : Molino Loco
Country : Spain
Alch% : 14%
type : red
Description : The 2011 Molino Loco Tinto is grown in the Castaño family vineyards, situated in the north of Yecla located at an altitude of 750 metres above sea level. The vineyards are dry-farmed (they are not irrigated) and the limestone soil is poor. This means that the roots of the vines grow deep into the earth in their search for precious minerals and nutrients, which helps ensure healthy, ripe, flavoursome grapes. The Monastrell vineyards are over 50 years old, while the Syrah vines are slightly younger, averaging around 15 years. Bright cherry red in colour with purple tints. On the nose aromas of fresh red plums and cherries are followed by notes of balsamic and a floral hint. Balanced on the palate with soft, juicy tannins and plenty of ripe red and black fruit character with a touch of sweet spice to finish.
